"Design a modern, interactive Java Coding Challenge Game web app interface.
Features should include:

A colorful header with the title 'Java Coding Challenge Game' and a fun icon (like a coffee cup for Java).

A scoreboard section at the top showing Score, Streak, and Completed challenges.

Three difficulty level buttons: Beginner (blue), Intermediate (green), Advanced (orange/red).

A quiz card in the center with:

Question title (e.g., Variable Declaration1)

Question description (e.g., What is the correct way to declare an integer variable in Java?)

A code snippet area styled in dark mode.

Multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D) in button format, with correct answers highlighted in green when selected.

A Submit Answer button in a rounded modern style.

A clean, modern layout with gradient backgrounds (pink to purple), rounded corners, and soft shadows.

The overall design should look engaging, gamified, and easy to use, with a professional but playful style."




























Prompt:

Create a modern, interactive Java Coding Challenge Game web app with the following specifications:

Design & Layout:

Gradient background from pink to purple (#667eea to #764ba2)
Clean, modern design with rounded corners and soft shadows
Fully responsive layout that works on all devices
Professional but playful, gamified appearance
Header Section:

Large title "Java Coding Challenge Game" with coffee cup emoji (â˜•)
Subtitle: "Test your Java knowledge and level up your coding skills!"
White text with drop shadows
Scoreboard:

Semi-transparent white card with backdrop blur
Three columns showing: Score, Streak, Completed challenges
Large white numbers with smaller labels below
Updates in real-time as user plays
Difficulty Selection:

Three buttons: Beginner (blue), Intermediate (green), Advanced (orange-red gradient)
Rounded pill-shaped buttons with hover effects and scaling
Selected difficulty gets a white ring highlight
Different point values: Beginner (10pts), Intermediate (20pts), Advanced (30pts)
Quiz Card:

Large white card with rounded corners and shadow
Question title and description at the top
Dark mode code snippet area with syntax highlighting (green text on dark background)
Four multiple choice options (A, B, C, D) in a 2x2 grid
Options have hover effects and selection highlighting
Submit button with purple-pink gradient
Result message area that shows correct/incorrect with explanations
Functionality Requirements:

Fully functional scoring system with streak tracking
Question cycling within each difficulty level
Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers (green/red highlighting)
Explanations appear after each answer
Next question button appears after submission
All buttons and interactions must work completely
Question Data Structure:

Use this exact JSON structure for questions:

{
  "beginner": [
    {
      "title": "Variable Declaration1",
      "description": "What is the correct way to declare an integer variable in Java?",
      "code": "// Which declaration is correct?\nint number = 42;",
      "options": [
        "int number = 42;",
        "Integer number = 42;",
        "int number = \"42\";",
        "number int = 42;"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Option A is correct. 'int' is the primitive data type for integers."
    }
  ],
  "intermediate": [...],
  "advanced": [...]
}

Technical Requirements:

Single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
Use Tailwind CSS for styling
Smooth animations and transitions
Proper error handling and user feedback
Clean, maintainable code structure
Interactive Features:

Click difficulty to load questions for that level
Click options to select answers
Submit button enables only after selection
Visual highlighting of correct/incorrect answers
Automatic score calculation and display
Streak resets on wrong answers
Cycle through questions with Next button
The final result should be a polished, fully-functional coding quiz game that looks professional and provides an engaging learning experience for Java developers.

I'll make sure answers can only be submitted once by disabling all option buttons after submission!

Now when you submit an answer:

All option buttons become disabled and unclickable
The cursor changes to "not-allowed" over the options
Click handlers are removed to prevent any interaction
A flag tracks if the answer was already submitted
The submit button is disabled after use

show current question number and total number of questions, 
When last question is submitted show an nice popup with results

Perfect! I've added a beautiful animated progress bar that shows your completion status throughout the quiz. Here's what's new:

Progress Bar Features:

Shows current progress as both a visual bar and percentage
Beautiful blue-to-purple gradient that matches the game's theme
Smooth 500ms animation when progressing between questions
Updates automatically as you move through each question
Positioned right below the question counter for easy visibility
The progress bar fills up as you advance through the questions, giving you a clear visual indication of how much of the quiz you've completed. Try switching between difficulty levels and answering questions to see the smooth progress animation in action!




moved the "Next Question" button right next to the "Submit Answer" button for a cleaner, more intuitive layout

Everytime someone takes quiz, can u generate different kinds of gems which looks very good/// and then keep on adding them at the end of the page... like achievements... user can come again next day and play quiz again to get new gems... each new gem should be unique and appealing
